## Summary 
During my student days, I had internships at several startups, where I honed my practical technical skills and business acumen.

Later, after graduating from the University of Tokyo with a Bachelor of Engineering degree, I was involved in the launch of a new business at Gunosy Inc.

In addition, I'm a founding member of Industry Technology Inc, where I serve as CTO. Here I'm driving the development of the SaaS product and providing technical leadership.

I have also served as a technical advisor for several companies on the side, helping to solve business and technical problems from multiple perspectives.
